## About Me

Dr. Dan Alfaros Kabella is a Xicanx trans organizer and scholar from Yrisarri, with deep-rooted connections to the peoples of Chilili (Tewa) in the Mexico–U.S. borderlands. They hold a PhD in Human and Social Dimensions of Science and Technology from Arizona State University. Their research and organizing bridge place-based knowledge, abolitionist praxis, and critical inquiry, tracing how contemporary harm reduction and community care are rooted in the borderlands’ long-standing traditions of anticolonial, antiracist, and abolitionist resistance. Dan’s work integrates archival storytelling, multimodal methods, and critical study of methadone, opioids, and other pharmaceuticals, centering cuerpo–territorio (body–territory) as a framework for embodied knowledge and resistance.

## Research Interests

- **Archival practice and digital humanities:** connecting industry archives, grassroots collections, and public engagement through exhibitions and multisensory storytelling
- **Critical histories of pharmaceuticals:** methadone, opioid industries, harm reduction, and their intersections with policy and colonialism
